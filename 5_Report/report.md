# Title OF THE PROJECT
  Battery Management System of lithium-ion battery
  

# ABSTRACT
This project deals with a Battery Management system (BMS)are used in many industrial and commercial systems to make the battery operation more efficient and for the estimation to keep the battery state, as long as possible, away from destructive state, to increase battery life time. For this purpose, many monitor techniques are used to monitor the battery state of charge, temperature and current. In the current project, the monitoring system for battery powered electric vehicles (EV) has been implementation tested. This system evaluates and displays the state of charge (SOC) for the considered model battery. The battery information and the obtained results explaining the main characteristics of the system are given by the LCD screen.

# OBJECTIVES
1. To understand and calculate the SOC (state of charge) of the battery.
2. TO develop a mathematical model of the system to obtain the relevant equations.
3. To solve the model by Simpsonâ€™s 1/3rd rule.
4. To develop C program to obtain the desired result i.e. the state of charge of the batter.

# CONCLUSION
In this project, a coulomb counting method for state of charge estimation for lithium ion batteries is detailed. This algorithm allows the system to operate in safe conditions by respecting the secure operating area of the lithium ion battery to prevent over charge and deep-discharge. To enhance the estimation accuracy, a recalibration at full and empty states is carried out and an evaluation of the state of health was considered.
